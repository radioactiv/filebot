# Purpose of fork
Want to get rid of the fake update notification in filebot?  Tired of the donate request when you close it?  You can modify the content of the original JAR and disable these things.  
*I got annoyed that the orig. version no longer works with tvdb because the author deactivated the API key.

All that is fixed (somewhat).  Replace the .jar file from your installation with the .jar file in this repo and everything works.


If you're interested in the "how" this repo provides the following:
 * Publicly available commands to use the Java JDK to compile a Java file.
 * Publicly available commands to use the Java JDK to replace files in a JAR file.
 * Basic information on using the open source program Luyten [https://github.com/deathmarine/Luyten] to decompile Java .class files into Java source code.

Tips: 
  * "//" comments out code in Java.
  * The Java compiler (javac) gives you the line number of an error.
